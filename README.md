# Interactive Registration Form

## Overview

This project is a simple interactive registration form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form includes basic user input fields for username, email, and password, with client-side validation to ensure that the data entered is correct before submission.

## Features

- **Client-side validation**: Checks for required fields, valid email format, and password length.
- **Responsive design**: The form is centered and styled for a clean, user-friendly experience.
- **Error handling**: Displays error messages near the respective input fields and highlights errors with red borders.

## Project Structure



## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-registration-form.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

    ```sh
    cd interactive-registration-form
    ```

3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser** to view the form:

    ```sh
    open index.html
    ```

   Alternatively, you can use a local development server if you have one set up.

## Usage

1. **Fill out the form fields**:
    - Enter a username.
    - Provide a valid email address.
    - Set a password (at least 6 characters long).

2. **Submit the form**:
    - If all fields are valid, a success message will appear.
    - If there are errors, the form will display error messages next to the respective fields.

## File Descriptions

- **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML structure of the form.
- **`css/style.css`**: Contains styles for the form and its elements.
- **`js/script.js`**: Contains JavaScript code for form validation and error handling.


## Contributing

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
